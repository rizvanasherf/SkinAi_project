# SkinAI: Skin Disease Detection and Chatbot Assistance
## Overview
SkinAI is a comprehensive application designed to assist users in detecting and understanding various skin diseases. The project leverages advanced machine learning models for image classification and a conversational chatbot for providing additional information and support. The application is built using Streamlit for the frontend and backend, and it integrates Hugging Face APIs for embedding models and the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 model for the chatbot.

## Features
Image Classification: Detect five common skin diseases using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model saved in a .h5 file.

- Acne or Rosacea

- Eczema

- Fungal Infection

- Seborrheic Keratoses or other Benign Tumors

- Warts Molluscum or other Viral Infections

 Chatbot Assistance: A conversational chatbot powered by Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, enhanced with FASSI for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for vector embeddings.

 User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for uploading images and interacting with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- Machine Learning Model: InceptionV3 for image classification.

- Chatbot: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 for conversational assistance.

- Vector Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for generating embeddings.

- Frontend and Backend: Streamlit for building the web application.

- APIs: Hugging Face APIs for embedding models and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.
